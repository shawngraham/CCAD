      <description>Generative adversarial networks can &amp;lsquo;paint&amp;rsquo; images or retrieve &amp;lsquo;photographs&amp;rsquo; of things that never existed. We are training a GAN on a series of site photographs as part of a 3d photogrammetry workflow, to computationally hallucinate the site.
Below are some examples of other GAN projects
 GAN Gogh A project by Kenny Jones and Derrick Bonafilia, training a GAN on European Masters. Their code repo is on Github. Write-up on Towards Data Science.</description>

      <title>What _is_ computational creativity, anyway?</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s late at night, and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to pound out some words so that I have it on the screen what, roughly, I think is the/an answer to this question. I will come back to this over and over again during this project, I&amp;rsquo;m sure. Expect non-sequiturs.
In their introduction to the issue of Internet Archaeology devoted to digital creativity, Gareth Beale and Paul Reilly point out how archaeologists tend to downplay the &amp;lsquo;theoretical implications [of digital tools] and to characterise methodological transformation in terms of technological innovation&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>I have spent a lot of time this afternoon getting this website up and running. But success!
I&amp;rsquo;ve also got some generative and siamese network experiments underway
some blurry computer hallucinations of a cleaned excavation trench</description>

      <description>Through the machines we employ, we are able to stretch our imaginations into new worlds, to ask new questions and find new solutions to old problems&amp;rdquo; - Rose Ferraby, &amp;lsquo;Geophysics: Creativity and the Archaeological Imagination&amp;rsquo;
This project is my contribution to the larger CRANE - Computational Research in the Ancient Near East project. With my research students, we are exploring ways we can creatively reuse legacy archaeological data (whether from the Ancient Near East or elsewhere) to generate new insights, new inspirations, new enchantments.</description>
