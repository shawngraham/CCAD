I would like to train an image recognition model with my own images to see how well it works. Here I want to use the obverse of coins to make a model to recognize the portraits of Elizabeth II (younger), Elizabeth II (more mature), George VI and Abraham Lincoln.
Initially I used 5 cent coins but I found they reflected too much light to take a good photograph so I switched to 1 cent coins.</description>

      <title>Computational Creativity and Archaeological Data Project - Getting Started</title>

      <description>crossposted from Jeff&amp;rsquo;s blog. Jeff is an MA History and Data Science student @CarletonU.
I am doing research for the Computational Creativity and Archaeological Data project. My current challenge has been to use techniques from Computer Vision to analyse images relevant to Computational Research on the Ancient Near East (CRANE) with the goal to provide additional understanding of these images. Computer Vision and machine learning could identify and classify elements in images or provide a possible reconstruction of a partial artifact using an image of it combined with a model of images of related artifacts.</description>

      <title>Introducing Jeff Blackadar</title>

      <description>Jeff Blackadar is a part-time MA student in the Department of History, pursuing an MA in History with Data Science. As an undergrad, he published a lesson on MySQL with R in The Programming Historian. His work on the CCAD project will explore techniques of in-painting and image completion on archaeological photography, and the ways these images can be used for photogrammetry and the exploration of &amp;lsquo;fuzziness&amp;rsquo; in computational imagination / archaeological reconstruction.</description>

      <title>3d Photogrammetry in the Cloud with Meshroom</title>

      <description>Meshroom ~ &amp;ldquo;Meshroom is a free, open-source 3D Reconstruction Software based on the AliceVision Photogrammetric Computer Vision framework.&amp;rdquo;
The software runs with a GUI for Windows or Mac; but it can be run in the cloud and can take advantage of Google&amp;rsquo;s GPU-enabled collaborative notebooks.
Have your images zipped up, and then run this notebook: Google Colab
Upload the zip file, run each code block in turn. The code was first posted to Gist by donmahallem.</description>

      <description>The EMOTIVE project is using chatbots to foster archaeological empathy. I&amp;rsquo;m wondering, can I use a chatbot as a way of exploring the latent idea space of published archeological knowledge?
Allison Parrish&amp;rsquo;s bot demonstrates how to build a chatbot trained on the Cornell Movie Dialogue Database. My ambition here is to train the bot on the written outputs of the CRANE project: an informed archaeological chatbot. The chatbot learns the archaeological words and via word embeddings the universe of related concepts.</description>

      <description>Generative adversarial networks can &amp;lsquo;paint&amp;rsquo; images or retrieve &amp;lsquo;photographs&amp;rsquo; of things that never existed. We are training a GAN on a series of site photographs as part of a 3d photogrammetry workflow, to computationally hallucinate the site.
Below are some examples of other GAN projects
 GAN Gogh A project by Kenny Jones and Derrick Bonafilia, training a GAN on European Masters. Their code repo is on Github. Write-up on Towards Data Science.</description>

      <title>What _is_ computational creativity, anyway?</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s late at night, and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to pound out some words so that I have it on the screen what, roughly, I think is the/an answer to this question. I will come back to this over and over again during this project, I&amp;rsquo;m sure. Expect non-sequiturs.
In their introduction to the issue of Internet Archaeology devoted to digital creativity, Gareth Beale and Paul Reilly point out how archaeologists tend to downplay the &amp;lsquo;theoretical implications [of digital tools] and to characterise methodological transformation in terms of technological innovation&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>I have spent a lot of time this afternoon getting this website up and running. But success!
I&amp;rsquo;ve also got some generative and siamese network experiments underway

      <description>Through the machines we employ, we are able to stretch our imaginations into new worlds, to ask new questions and find new solutions to old problems&amp;rdquo; - Rose Ferraby, &amp;lsquo;Geophysics: Creativity and the Archaeological Imagination&amp;rsquo;
This project is my contribution to the larger CRANE - Computational Research in the Ancient Near East project. With my research students, we are exploring ways we can creatively reuse legacy archaeological data (whether from the Ancient Near East or elsewhere) to generate new insights, new inspirations, new enchantments.</description>
