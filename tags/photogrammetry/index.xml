      <description>Meshroom ~ &amp;ldquo;Meshroom is a free, open-source 3D Reconstruction Software based on the AliceVision Photogrammetric Computer Vision framework.&amp;rdquo;
The software runs with a GUI for Windows or Mac; but it can be run in the cloud and can take advantage of Google&amp;rsquo;s GPU-enabled collaborative notebooks.
Have your images zipped up, and then run this notebook: Google Colab
Upload the zip file, run each code block in turn. The code was first posted to Gist by donmahallem.</description>

      <description>Generative adversarial networks can &amp;lsquo;paint&amp;rsquo; images or retrieve &amp;lsquo;photographs&amp;rsquo; of things that never existed. We are training a GAN on a series of site photographs as part of a 3d photogrammetry workflow, to computationally hallucinate the site.
Below are some examples of other GAN projects
 GAN Gogh A project by Kenny Jones and Derrick Bonafilia, training a GAN on European Masters. Their code repo is on Github. Write-up on Towards Data Science.</description>
