      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve done not a particularly good job of keeping this website up to date. But we have been busy.
In the fall, we arranged for some more data science training for Jeff, and he&amp;rsquo;s been working hard on learning Keras and other packages and approaches for the various tasks we have in mind for this project. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reposting some of his open research notes here, but since I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen behind, I&amp;rsquo;ll just link over to his notes here.</description>

      <description>crossposted from Jeff&amp;rsquo;s blog. Jeff is an MA History and Data Science student @CarletonU.
I would like to train an image recognition model with my own images to see how well it works. Here I want to use the obverse of coins to make a model to recognize the portraits of Elizabeth II (younger), Elizabeth II (more mature), George VI and Abraham Lincoln.
Initially I used 5 cent coins but I found they reflected too much light to take a good photograph so I switched to 1 cent coins.</description>
