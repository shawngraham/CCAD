[Computational creativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_creativity) is what happens when we try to use the machine as a creative partner, a shattered prism, a performance enhancing drug. It's a wonderful partnership between the machine, art, and humanistic understanding of the past. One of the best examples I can think of right now is Ferraby and St. John's [Soundmarks](https://soundmarks.co.uk/) 'using sound and visual art to explore and animate the sub-surface landscape of Aldborough Roman Town in North Yorkshire, UK'.

I wrote a tutorial on sonification for [the Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sonification); I'll just restate what I wrote there:

_[...]often we forget what a creative act visualization is. We are perhaps too tied to our screens, too much invested in ‘seeing’. Let me hear something of the past instead._

_While there is a deep history and literature on archaeoacoustics and soundscapes that try to capture the sound of a place as it was (see for instance the [Virtual St. Paul’s](https://www.digitalstudies.org/articles/10.16995/dscn.58) or the work of [Jeff Veitch on ancient Ostia](https://jeffdveitch.wordpress.com/)), I am interested instead to ’sonify’ what I have right now, the data themselves. I want to figure out a grammar for representing data in sound that is appropriate for history. Drucker famously [reminds us that ‘data’ are not really things given, but rather things captured](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sonification#Drucker), things transformed: that is to say, ‘capta’. In sonifying data, I literally perform the past in the present, and so the assumptions, the transformations, I make are foregrounded. The resulting aural experience is a literal ‘deformance’ (portmanteau of ‘deform’ and ‘perform’) that makes us hear modern layers of the past in a new way._

**That's** the sense of computational creativity that this project is trying to capture. We will sonify things. But we're also going to use neural networks to see things like machines. We're going to make physical things that are not, normally, 3d - colour data. Vibrational intensities. We'll listen to colour. We'll print sound. We'll hallucinate landscapes into plastic models from found images.

_I want to hear the meaning of the past, but I know that I can’t. Nevertheless, when I hear an instrument, I can imagine the physicality of the player playing it; in its echoes and resonances I can discern the physical space. I can feel the bass; I can move to the rhythm. The music engages my whole body, my whole imagination. Its associations with sounds, music, and tones I’ve heard before create a deep temporal experience, a system of embodied relationships between myself and the past. Visual? We have had visual representations of the past for so long, we have almost forgotten the artistic and performative aspect of those grammars of expression._
