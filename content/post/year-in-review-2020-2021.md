I'm... I'm not entirely sure. We were all busy, but it was the kind of busy that doesn't really translate into immediate products. The problem with working with legacy datasets is finding legacy datasets you can work with. But really... the world's been on fire. Things slipped down the cracks.

Some of the team graduated. Emma Gillies has moved on, after using what she learned here to visually analyze the evolution of Canadian craft beer labels (!) over the last 100 years, especially in how they make appeals to Canadian nationalism in different ways over that time. In essence, she was able to read/see a change in the visual promulgation of Canadian nationalism over time. Jamie Simons joined the team. Chantal Brousseau has nipped in and out working on various bits and bobs.

I'm not sure if this was really what U of T had in mind when they invited me to join the larger project, but we've taken a skunkworks approach to this project. It'll pay off.

We did publish this, with support from both this project and the Bonetrade project:
