_Through the machines we employ, we are able to stretch our imaginations into new worlds, to ask new questions and find new solutions to old problems" - [Rose Ferraby, 'Geophysics: Creativity and the Archaeological Imagination'](https://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue44/4/2.html)_

This project is my contribution to the larger [CRANE - Computational Research in the Ancient Near East](https://crane.utoronto.ca/) project. With my research students, we are exploring ways we can creatively reuse legacy archaeological data (whether from the Ancient Near East or elsewhere) to generate new insights, new inspirations, new [enchantments](https://saraperry.wordpress.com/2019/07/25/its-published-archaeological-enchantment/).

Sara Perry writes,

> _I believe archaeology can change the world for the better through its inherent and highly distinctive capacity to generate wonder and enchantment among human beings. [...] I believe we can deliberately weave affective practices into all aspects of our archaeological methodologies and project designs, therein offering us a more contextual and dynamic model for doing, recording, interpreting, publicising and archiving archaeology._

And I think she's right.
