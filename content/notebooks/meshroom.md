[Meshroom](https://alicevision.org/#meshroom) ~ "Meshroom is a free, open-source 3D Reconstruction Software based on the AliceVision Photogrammetric Computer Vision framework."

The software runs with a GUI for Windows or Mac; but it can be run in the cloud and can take advantage of Google's GPU-enabled collaborative notebooks.

Have your images zipped up, and then run this notebook: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/o-date/photogrammetry/blob/master/Meshroom_%2B_GPU_for_Photogrammetry.ipynb)

Upload the zip file, run each code block in turn. The code was first posted to Gist by [donmahallem](https://gist.github.com/donmahallem/22134574382b7bd8a67c1550734fcfc4). Documentation for the command line interface seems to be a work-in-progress; see [this repo](https://github.com/natowi/meshroom_doc)
